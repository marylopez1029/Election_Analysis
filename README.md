Election Analysis for Colorado Board of Elections

The purpose of this election analysis is to aid the Coloradoo Board of Elections in tallying votes and extrapolating
meaningful data from voter turn out and voter dispersion. The points of contacts are with the employees Seth and Tom.
Dependent on the data, the coding and approach to tallying votes may be used for future elections, and for larger scale elections
outside of Colorado as well. 

Election Audit Results
----------------------------------
Total votes: 369,711
The total votes is rather small- but it doesn't account for voters who abstained.
----------------------------------
Voter Dispersion by County:
Jefferson: 10.5% (38,855)
Denver: 82.8% (306,055)
Arapahoe: 6.7% (24,801)

Most of the voters were in Denver, which signifies that Denver consumes the most resources and needs the most attention in
terms of political campaigns. Future politicians may make decisions accordingly on budgeting and distribution of political events in the area.
----------------------------------
Largest County Turnout: Denver
----------------------------------
Candidate Voter Distribution
Charles Casper Stockham: 23.0% (85,213)
Diana DeGette: 73.8% (272, 892)
Raymon Anthony Doane: 3.1% (11,606)

The voter distribution amongst the candidates was very vast. This could signify major backing and funding for the successful candidates and may need
closer inspection or audits depending on the history of the candidate. Otherwise, the candidate may display successful political campaigns that
others may mimic in the future and could set a precedent in how politicians approach campagining. 
-----------------------------------
Winner: Diana DeGette
Winning Vote Count: 272,892
Winning Percentage: 73.8%

As stated, the different between the winning candidate and the others is so vast, the likelihood of major political tension or pushback when 
implementing new policies is low. Most likely, the newly elected official will be successful in carrying out their projects and would likely 
have more support from the citizens.

Closing Statements for the Electoral Commisions
This was a good segway into developing a software that could readily make election data more accessible
and meaningful. The coding however was unable to be complete on this end due to technical issues and a lack of time,
but the ability and potential to extract data and create data that informs is great. This would inform the electoral commissions
possible changes in political affiliations in the area, as well as possible changes in population, and general trends of 
what the community finds important with regards to politics and could be a good indicator as to what the government should focus on
in terms of subsidies, policy making, innovation, education, etc.The code is also flexible wherein more user input could be placed and more data could be extracted about the area and the demographics.
